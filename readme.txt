How to use  : You just enter "./run_all.sh" in this directory (you must be root to execute)
Output file : perf_analyze.csv

If you want to change the script, I recommend you to read "run_all.sh" and other related script.

If you want to change the performance counter event, you should change "p_rec.sh", "perf2csv_old.sh", and "perf_analyze_count.py"
If you want to change the program to measure, you should change "spec_binary.sh"
